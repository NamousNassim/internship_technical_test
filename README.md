## AI-Powered Q&A System


# Goal 
    - 1️⃣ Ingest documents (text files or PDFs).
    - 2️⃣ Embed the documents using OpenAI embeddings (or an open-source model).
    - 3️⃣ Store embeddings in a vector database (FAISS, ChromaDB, or Pinecone).
    - 4️⃣ Retrieve relevant information and generate an AI-powered response.


# Requirements : 

    -• Use Python and frameworks like LangChain, FAISS, or ChromaDB.
    -• Allow users to input a question, retrieve relevant documents, and generate a response using an LLM.
    -• Use OpenAI API (or Hugging Face models if preferred).
    -• Provide a Jupyter Notebook or Python script with a short README explaining your approach.
